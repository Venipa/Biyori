/// Parse a single filename that may carry a directory prefix, so the result
/// describes the file rather than the folder.
///
/// [`parse`](crate::anitomy::parse) treats its input as one flat string, matching
/// upstream, so a path leaves separators and duplicated folder text in the
/// title. This strips a real directory prefix first and recovers a title that
/// lives only in the parent folder. Both `/` and `\` work on every platform,
/// including UNC and drive-letter roots.
///
/// Without a directory prefix this is exactly [`parse`](crate::anitomy::parse), and a
/// separator inside a title (`Fate/stay night`) is left alone.

/// let title = elements.iter().find(|e| e.kind == ElementKind::Title);
/// assert_eq!(title.map(|e| e.value.as_str()), Some("Frieren"));

/// For a set of related files, prefer [`parse_together`], which additionally
